        Veronica Roth.

        It is set in a future society divided into five factions, each
        representing a different virtue: Abnegation (selflessness), Amity
        (peace), Candor (honesty), Dauntless (bravery), and Erudite (knowledge).

        The story follows Tris Prior, a young woman who discovers she is
        "Divergent" and does not fit into any one faction. As she uncovers a
        conspiracy to destroy all Divergents, Tris must learn to embrace her
        identity and fight for her survival.
